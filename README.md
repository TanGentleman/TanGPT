# TanGPT

* Built around privacy.
* Fully open-source.
* Supports new larger 16K context for gpt-3.5, and 32k for those with gpt-4 access.
* Maintained by Tan.

### My preferred way to run [MacOS]:
1. Clone this repository.
2. cd into the repo named TanGPT (i.e. `cd Downloads/TanGPT`)
3. `yarn`
4. `yarn build`
5. `yarn dev` for Web UI, accessing via browser at localhost:$PORT as the url, substituting $PORT from the output you'll get.
5. `yarn electron` for an Electron app instance instead (my go-to)
6. If using the official OpenAI endpoint, enter your api key from the API at the bottom left, it is stored locally and privately.

# Please do not abuse the personal endpoint I host and provide as a proxy for testing.
